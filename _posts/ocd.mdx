# What's the OCD
Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental and behavioral disorder 
in which a person has certain thoughts repeatedly (called "obsessions") and/or feels the need to perform certain routines repeatedly (called "compulsions") 
to an extent that generates distress or impairs general functioning.
The person is unable to control either the thoughts or activities for more than a short period of time.
Common compulsions include excessive hand washing, the counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked.

As the OCD's shadows upon my mental like a ghost, I know it's mark that my happiness time is almost over.

I always think something odd such like "what if a dog bit me?"I know it's impossible and it's a incorrectly thought.but...you know, I can't stop to thinking about it, this feeling is more terrible  than everything what I had experience.So I hate all the cat and dogs,hate blood, hate every object that cause me anxious…
  my father said to me that,TRY TO  RESPECT IT'S EXISTENCE  WHEN  SOMEONE OR SOMETHING YOU CANNOT TURN IT DOWN.
I know he said it because he love me,but the words cannot change this situation even if a bit of it,but I still want to send this words to all of you.
I still take medicines every day,and always think of how much my family spent because of it... it make me feel remorse,and I still have not idea to what bring the OCD to me. 
I wanna express my gratitude to everyone who wishes me would go through this dilemma, because of you, I started to believe that tomorrow will be better，and telling to myself: everything in yard is rosy.
